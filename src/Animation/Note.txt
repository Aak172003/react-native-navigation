Steps How implement animation in react native
    1. Wrap that View with Animated.View
    2. Create a new Animated.Value using useRef because as docs suggest that useRef is best practice for this
    3. Use that Animated.Value in style prop of Animated.View



What I pass to Animated.timing function:
    1. The Animated.Value that we want to animate
    2. An object with configuration options:
       - toValue: the final value we want to animate to
       - duration: how long the animation should take (in milliseconds)
       - easing: (optional) 
       - useNativeDriver: set to true for better performance when animating only supported properties
